Completed as part of a technical exercise for a job application.  I was emailed specs from:
https://gist.github.com/jesseadams/8dd29d63f2d65287a675 

And produced the following code.  The second commit was complete within the 90 minute timeframe, I detected a bug on multiple runs of the game which I fixed ~15 minutes after the exercise's 90-minute timebox.
